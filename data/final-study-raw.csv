1. On page 2 (Upset-Alttext-User-Survey/2), there is typo: ""an can contains 2-3 sets, like ...).
2. You ask the questions on the left and show the visualizations/caption on the right. Shouldn't it be opposite? I start from the left and see the questions first, without any idea on what the question is. 
3. In page 3, the Romance column is highlighted, but I dont know why it is highlighted. 
4. In many questions, it feels like there should be only 1 answer, but you give me check boxes instead of radio buttons. For example, in page 4 ""What is the largest intersection?"", there should be radio buttons of all intersections. But I see 5 sets and empty intersection. Is selecting ""Adventure"" and ""Empty Intersection (no sets)"" a valid answer?
5. I don't understand the training about no set intersections. On page 4, you say that the largest intersection is Just Adventure (233), but the correct answer for the largest intersection is ""Empty"". Did you mean the largest 5 NON-EMPTY intersections are Just Adventure (233) ....? A little more clarification might help. 
6. There can be speed/confidence bias as the number of trials passes. I dont know if you did this or not, but shuffling the trials might be important to get accurace confidence metrices from the participants. For example, for some participants, show them the visualization only question first, then the text only question, and the both questions.","undefined","undefined","undefined","2024-07-31T04:20:20.265Z","2024-07-31T04:23:37.201Z","196936","ecdced17dc1fd86b8b83f4914646d257990133f94230749d2417f2136be6214d"

The sets were very easy to understand. The intersections are slightly bit more confusing. I would recommend to see if there are other graphs or plots that can be used to depict the various intersections. In most of todays scientific articles, you should not have to read instructions to understand the graph or at the very least, you should be able to interpret the data with minimal amount of reading. In this instance, we had to carefully read the instructions several times to understand what an intersection was. Other than that, it was easy to understand and interpret.
